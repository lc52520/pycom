PYCOM --- Python DICOM Processing Toolkit for BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc.

PYCOM is a collection of DICOM processing tools coded in the Python programming language 
for assisting MC simulation using BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc using RT plans generated from a TPS system. 
It currently has tools (a) pycom.py: generating input files automatically for BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc 
from DICOM RT Plans (DICOM RP) exported from a Treatment Planning System (TPS), 
(b) pycom_dose.py: converting the dose distribution generated by DOSXYZnrc in 3ddose format 
to DICOM RT Dose (DICOM RD) format so that it can be imported by a DICOM processing software, 
and (c) pycom_anon.py: anonymizing DICOM files for patient privacy. 

See the comments in the files for the usage of the tools.

Note: The current version is for BEAMnrc version 2011. 
Tools for BEAMnrc version 2013 is in development.
