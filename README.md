pycom --- Python DICOM Processing Toolkit for BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc


PYCOM toolkit is a collection of DICOM processing tools coded in the Python programming language. 
It currently has tools for (a) generating input files automatically for BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc from DICOM RT Plans (DICOM RP) 
exported from a Treatment Planning System (TPS), (b) converting the dose distribution generated by DOSXYZnrc 
in 3ddose format to DICOM RT Dose (DICOM RD) format so that it can be imported by a DICOM processing software, 
and (c) anonymizing DICOM files for patient privacy.
